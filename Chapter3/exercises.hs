{- Reading Syntax Exercises

    1.For the following lines of code, read the syntax carefully and
    decide if they are written correctly. Test them in your REPL
    after youâ€™ve decided to check your work. Correct as many as
    you can.

        a) concat [[1,2,3], [4,5,6]]
        Answer: This should work. Concat takes a list of lists of a
                generic type 'a' and the input above statisfies that
                requirement
        b) ++ [1,2,3] [4,5,6]
        Answer: Will not compile. ++ is a infix method, which means that it needs to go 
            between both arugments. It can be used in prefix form, however, by wrapping
            it up in parens.
        c) (++) "hello" " world"
        Answer: This will compile. ++ is wrapped in parens so it shouldn't have a problem
                with being in prefix form.
        d) ["hello" ++ " world]
        Answer: Does not compile. World is missing a close double quote adter d
        e) 4 !! "hello"
        Answer: Does not compile. The arguements need to be flipped.
        f) (!!) "hello" 4
        Answer: Does Compile. See c) for explaination
        g) take "4 lovely"
        Answer: Does not compie. 4 needs to be out sound of and before the quote marks
        h) take 3 "awesome"
        Answer: Does compile.

    2. Next we have two sets: the first set is lines of code and the other
    is a set of results. Read the code and figure out which results
    came from which lines of code. Be sure to test them in the
    REPL.

        a) concat [[1 * 6], [2 * 6], [3 * 6]]
        Answer: d) [6,12,18]

        b) "rain" ++ drop 2 "elbow"
        Answer: c) "rainbow"

        c) 10 * head [1, 2, 3]
        Answer: e) 10

        d) (take 3 "Julie") ++ (tail "yes")
        Answer: a) "Jules"

        e) concat [tail [1, 2, 3],
                   tail [4, 5, 6],
                   tail [7, 8, 9]]
        Answer: b) [2,3,5,6,8,9]
